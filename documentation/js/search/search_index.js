Another benefit is it is written in \n        pure JavaScript/HTML, and thus can be extended and utilized within any framework/development context. \n        \n        \n        Finally, a key benefit of using PDF.js over other editors is it is free and open-source.

annotations application for Buildertrend Inc, an Omaha-based company which\nprovides construction management software. This application will take the form of an Angular-based web application served on an \nAmazon EC2 instance. \nRELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 1:\nDeployment environment (EC2 server) set up. \n\nBarebones Angular project created and deployed on the instance. \n\nRouting between various pages has been set up. \n\nAll of the code for this release resides in the main branch. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 2:\nPDF.js viewer built into application. The viewer has features such as searching, \nopening PDF's fully client-side, and more. Annotations are not present yet but will be\nin a future release. \n\nDevelopment started on other pages. \n\nAdded a banner to the top of the application that is present across all pages. \n\nOther libraries beginning to be explored, but no active development as of now. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 3:\nPDF.js viewer with annotation features implemented. 2 other libraries are also in the project. An about section for PDF.js was added\nhighlighting some of the features of the application. \n\nPages for the other 2 libraries are created with viewers for each. No about section quite yet though for these pages. This will be done\nin milestone 4. \n\nStylistic reworks of some of the pages as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
