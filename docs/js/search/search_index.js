It is included standard in Mozilla Firefox, \n        and there also is an extension for Google Chrome. Thus, the supported browsers \n        for this particular application are Firefox and Chrome. \n        \n        \n        Some of the features that this version of the viewer includes are opening and viewing PDFs fully client-side, \n        annotating PDFs fully client-side, as well as loading annotations already present. In addition, there is a feature \n        to add text to the PDF as well. There are also various search and view features. One could also add to the viewer and\n        have it render PDFs from URLs, however, CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) concerns should be taken into account.  \n        \n        \n        In this version of the viewer, we did not find any mechanism for supporting .XMP files, nor support for images and layers without\n        adding on to the viewer. While these features are supported \n        by the library, and thus it would be possible to implement by extending the viewer, it would be fairly complex to do so. \n        \n        \n        Ultimately, however, the library does a lot of the heavy working with parsing/rendering PDFs, so it is possible to \n        add a lot of features by utilizing the library's APIs. That, in fact, is how the webviewer is built: it is not actually part\n        of the full library, but rather a demo meant to show what is possible via the library. Another benefit is it is written in \n        pure JavaScript/HTML, and thus can be extended and utilized within any framework/development context. \n        \n        \n        The library comes with much more features that can be utilized outside of those found in the viewer. For example, the library supports\n        dozens of annotation types not currently found in the viewer, such as lines, squares, circles, highlights, underlines, and much\n        more. Basically, any annotation officially supported by the PDF file specification is supported by the library. However, these features\n        would have to be built into the viewer itself to actually render them. \n        \n        \n        Unfortunately, we did not find any way to save the annotations separately from the PDF itself. The library computes and adds the annotations\n        directly to the actual file blob that gets downloaded to the client's machine. However, it is theoretically possible to build this feature\n        in outside of the library itself, but it would be complex and require a way to track the annotations outside of the library. \n  \n        \n        \n        Finally, a key benefit of using PDF.js over other editors is it is free and open-source. However, using the viewer we have embedded in our application \n        would require Buildertrend to build upon it or reskin it in some way in accordance with the licensing on the Github repo,\n        which is linked here.\n      \n    \n  \n    \n      About\n    \n    \n      Home\n    \n  \n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ./editor.component.scss\n                \n                \n    \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                Legend\n            \n            \n                Html element\n            \n            \n                Component\n            \n            \n                Html element with directive\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        var COMPONENT_TEMPLATE = '                        PDF.js Library              PDF.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed and supported by the Mozilla foundation.

annotations application for Buildertrend Inc, an Omaha-based company which\nprovides construction management software. This application will take the form of an Angular-based web application served on an \nAmazon EC2 instance. \nRELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 1:\nDeployment environment (EC2 server) set up. \n\nBarebones Angular project created and deployed on the instance. \n\nRouting between various pages has been set up. \n\nAll of the code for this release resides in the main branch. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 2:\nPDF.js viewer built into application. The viewer has features such as searching, \nopening PDF's fully client-side, and more. Annotations are not present yet but will be\nin a future release. \n\nDevelopment started on other pages. \n\nAdded a banner to the top of the application that is present across all pages. \n\nOther libraries beginning to be explored, but no active development as of now. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 3:\nPDF.js viewer with annotation features implemented. 2 other libraries are also in the project. An about section for PDF.js was added\nhighlighting some of the features of the application. \n\nPages for the other 2 libraries are created with viewers for each. No about section quite yet though for these pages. This will be done\nin milestone 4. \n\nStylistic reworks of some of the pages as necessary. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 4:\nOther viewers fully implemented in the application.Info sections about other viewers implemented on the respective pages. \nOn 2 of the pages, the default PDF was removed so the user can open their own PDF right away. \n\nA 4th page was added with a features comparison table. As part of milestone 5, this table will be built out \nto include features of the various libaries and summarized info. \n\nStylistic reworks of some of the pages as necessary. RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 5:\n    Comparison table finished with key comparisons made in the table. Updated the overall styling to reflect Buildertrend's color \n    scheme. Also updated the styling of the table to make it centered. A few other very minor changes were also implemented. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
