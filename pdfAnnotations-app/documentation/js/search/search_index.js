  \n\n    \n        \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      PDF.js Library\n      \n        PDF.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed and supported by the Mozilla foundation. It is included standard in Mozilla Firefox, \n        and there also is an extension for Google Chrome. Thus, the supported browsers \n        for this particular application are Firefox and Chrome. \n        \n        \n        Some of the features that this version of the viewer includes are opening and viewing PDFs fully client-side, \n        annotating PDFs fully client-side, as well as loading annotations already present. In addition, there is a feature \n        to add text to the PDF as well. There are also various search and view features. One could also add to the viewer and\n        have it render PDFs from URLs, however, CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) concerns should be taken into account.  \n        \n        \n        In this version of the viewer, we did not find any mechanism for supporting .XMP files, nor support for images and layers. \n        That is something that could be possible to implement by extending the viewer, but unfortunately is beyond our capabilities \n        as developers.\n        \n        \n        Ultimately, however, the library does a lot of the heavy working with parsing/rendering PDFs, so it is possible to \n        add a lot of features by utilizing the library's APIs. That, in fact, is how the webviewer is built: it is not actually part\n        of the full library, but rather a demo meant to show what is possible via the library. Another benefit is it is written in \n        pure JavaScript/HTML, and thus can be extended and utilized within any framework/development context. \n        \n        \n        Finally, a key benefit of using PDF.js over other editors is it is free and open-source.

It is included standard in Mozilla Firefox,         and there also is an extension for Google Chrome. Thus, the supported browsers         for this particular application are Firefox and Chrome.                         Some of the features that this version of the viewer includes are opening and viewing PDFs fully client-side,         annotating PDFs fully client-side, as well as loading annotations already present. In addition, there is a feature         to add text to the PDF as well. There are also various search and view features. One could also add to the viewer and        have it render PDFs from URLs, however, CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) concerns should be taken into account.                          In this version of the viewer, we did not find any mechanism for supporting .XMP files, nor support for images and layers.         That is something that could be possible to implement by extending the viewer, but unfortunately is beyond our capabilities         as developers.                        Ultimately, however, the library does a lot of the heavy working with parsing/rendering PDFs, so it is possible to         add a lot of features by utilizing the library\\'s APIs.
