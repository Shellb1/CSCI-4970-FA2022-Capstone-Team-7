This is the code repository for team #7 of the University of Nebraska-Omaha's CS Capstone class of Fall 2022. 

Our project is creating a client-side PDF annotations application for Buildertrend Inc, an Omaha-based company which
provides construction management software. This application will take the form of an Angular-based web application served on an 
Amazon EC2 instance. 

RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 1:

    Deployment environment (EC2 server) set up. 

    Barebones Angular project created and deployed on the instance. 

    Routing between various pages has been set up. 

    All of the code for this release resides in the main branch. 

RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 2:

    PDF.js viewer built into application. The viewer has features such as searching, 
    opening PDF's fully client-side, and more. Annotations are not present yet but will be
    in a future release. 

    Development started on other pages. 

    Added a banner to the top of the application that is present across all pages. 

    Other libraries beginning to be explored, but no active development as of now. 
    
RELEASE NOTES FOR MILESTONE 3:
    PDF.js viewer with annotation features implemented. 2 other libraries are also in the project. An about section for PDF.js was added
    highlighting some of the features of the application. 

    Pages for the other 2 libraries are created with viewers for each. No about section quite yet though for these pages. This will be done
    in milestone 4. 

    Stylistic reworks of some of the pages as necessary.
